PAKISTAN RAILWAY  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM $
PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a console-based Railway Management System developed
in C++. It is designed to manage train information, passenger records,
ticket reservations, and payment details. The system provides separate
functionalities for railway managers and passengers while maintaining
all records in text files for permanent storage.
